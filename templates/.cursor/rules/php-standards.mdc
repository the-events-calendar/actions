## Package Version Annotations

When needing to add a package version number inside a DocBlock, please use `TBD` as such:

- `@since TBD`
- `@deprecated TBD`
- `@deprecated since TBD`
- `_deprecated_function( __METHOD__, 'TBD' );` (other WordPress deprecation functions also work, but note it must be all on one line).

The `TBD` specifier will be automatically replaced with the correct package version number the next time a new version of that package is released.
